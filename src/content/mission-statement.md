On the left hand side of this page (or when you click the “About” button), I start with one sentence that gets at why I do many things I do. I love going on adventures and I love learning from data. 

I think that to adventure means to do much more than to go an exotic locale. To me, an adventure is to find myself somewhere I’ve never been. Sometimes, adventure takes me to the [top of yosemite falls](https://www.instagram.com/p/BcGek6DFIEe/), to my local climbing gym, or even around the block. 

I’m certainly on an adventure, putting these words to screen. 

Which brings me to why I am here, rebuilding my website for the up-teenth time.

I’m here to learn something new about the topics that interest me. 

I’m here to get data, analyze it, and communicate it so that others can learn alongside me. 

My mission statement?

I’m here to adventure.
